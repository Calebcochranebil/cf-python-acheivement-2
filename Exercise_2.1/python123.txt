Exercise 2.1: Getting Started with Django

Learning Goals

? Explain MVT architecture and compare it with MVC
? Summarize Django’s benefits and drawbacks 
? Install and get started with Django

Reflection Questions

1. Suppose you’re a web developer in a company and need to decide if you’ll use vanilla (plain) Python for a project, or a framework like Django instead. What are the advantages and drawbacks of each?
Vanilla Python:
Advantages: Flexible, easier to learn and use for small projects or specific needs.
Drawbacks: Requires more manual setup and coding for web functionalities, less structured for larger projects.

Django (Framework):
Advantages: Highly structured and organized, accelerates development with built-in features, follows DRY and MVC principles.
Drawbacks: Learning curve for beginners, potential over-complexity for simple projects.

2. In your own words, what is the most significant advantage of Model View Template (MVT) architecture over Model View Controller (MVC) architecture? The most significant advantage of Model View Template architecture over Model View Controller is that MVT separates the template logic from both the model and the view, providing a clearer separation of concerns. In MVT, the template handles the presentation and user interface, the view handles the business logic and data processing, and the model handles data storage and retrieval. This separation enhances modularity, making it easier to maintain and modify different aspects of the application independently.

3. Now that you’ve had an introduction to the Django framework, write down three goals you have for yourself and your learning process during this Achievement. You can reflect on the following questions if it helps:
? What do you want to learn about Django? Learn advanced Django features, such as authentication, permissions, and optimization.
? What do you want to get out of this Achievement? Gain practical experience by building a fully functional web application using Django.
? Where or what do you see yourself working on after you complete this Achievement? Aim to work on freelance Django projects or contribute to open-source Django projects post-achievement completion.
