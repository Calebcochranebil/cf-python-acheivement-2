Reflection Questions

1. Explain how you can use CSS and JavaScript in your Django web application. To use CSS and JavaScript in your Django web application, link your CSS files in HTML templates using the `{% load static %}` tag and include the `{% static %}` tag for file paths. For JavaScript, include scripts in your HTML templates, ensuring proper integration with Django's templating language.

2. In your own words, explain the steps you’d need to take to deploy your Django web application. To deploy the app on Heroku, I configured the project, set up environment variables, connected a database, and used the Heroku CLI for seamless deployment.

3. You’ve now finished Achievement 2 and, with it, the whole course! Take a moment to reflect on your learning:
a. What went well during this Achievement? Everything went smooth I felt. Always hit road blocks but if you read enough and keep trying it fixes itself. Deploying the app on heroku was easy.
b. What’s something you’re proud of? Im proud of how my app turned out. And how I overcame my test failures.
c. What was the most challenging aspect of this Achievement? I think the most challenging thing is how every little thing works. I know it works and understand how it works. But I don’t have a full grasp yet. But with time that will come.
d. Did this Achievement meet your expectations? Did it give you the confidence to start working with your new Django skills? Yes, I learned a lot even though I had to rush at the end. And I am confident to use my skills as a developer.

Well done—you’ve now completed the Learning Journal for the whole course.
